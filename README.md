# VIT2.4G-authenticator
It is a simple ruby script that does the following
* Allows you to login and log out manually
* Allows you to check the status of the curret session
* Automatically logs you out to 12:28 AM and sets up proxy provided that the script is running, so that you can enjoy proxy 
without speed restrictions and anonymously. 

# Compilation
Sorry I could not compile the rb file to exe because it requires me to run ocra at 12:28 AM so as to end the infinite loop.

# To-Do
* Adding the proxy server
* Minimizing to tray and run in background
* Hibernate when not connected to VIT2.4G
* Automatically shuts dpwn the proxy and logs the user in using the last knows credentials.
